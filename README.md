My first ever written program made in my final year of highschool before starting my CS degree.
Is it bad? Absolutely - no proper framework, no CS fundamentals, no code structure, no optimization.
Am I proud of it? Hell yes! It was my very first step, completely selftaught, into the world of computer science and as a first stepping stone, I think it came out pretty well!
